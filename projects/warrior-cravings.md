Warrior Cravings is a web application whose goal is to provide a food / restaurant guide for University of Hawaii at MƒÅnoa students. The web application aims to display the large selection of food options on and near campus to help students discover new flavor profiles or simply see where they can find their favorite foods. Moreover, this web application helps provide a small platform for the vendors on campus. This project was the final group project to showcase the cumulative understanding of what we learned about software engineering and web app development in our ICS 314 (Software Engineering I) class.

While working on this project my group members, Christine Nakano, Louie Bala, Jase Ishimi, and Zach Chaikin, and I used GitHub as our main hub for the project. We used the project feature to keep track of our milestones through issue driven project management. In addition GitHubs ability to create branches in order to break down the project made the organization aspect of the project much easier, especially when committing changes to the main branch. Although the majority of the communication between our group was online through discord and seeing the progress of the project through GitHub, I found that the process was effortless, especially with my partial absence due to Merrie Monarch. Our group would have weekly meetings to discuss our tasks and our challenges with our current tasks, helping each other or asking our TA for help when needed.

My contribution to the project mainly consisted of designing, testing, and managing the project. I helped to create the mockup pages for the web application in its beginning stages and took on tasks mostly to do with the actual visuals of the web application. As stated earlier I had a week leave of absence due to the Merrie Monarch competition, however I still made it a goal to keep track of the progress of my team members and project by making sure everything was going well. Finally, in the end stages of the project I took on the task of completing all of the acceptance testing for all of the web applications pages and forms.

Being that this was my very first group project making a web application using GitHub, I really learned the importance of consistent and effective communication, especially because the majority of the communication and group interaction took place online via discord. The issue driven project management on GitHub also made this process 10x easier to assign and complete tasks. Moreover, I learned not to bite off more than you can chew. Our group had big aspirations to create a likes system and filter system as special features of our web application, however with the time we had and the tasks that we were already working on we made the group decision to scrap those ideas and focus on the core tasks of the project. In the future it would be nice to try and implement these features, but for now I am proud of the final product.
